## Summary
The essential components of a language chain are as follows:
1. **Schema:** It refers to the structure or framework that defines the organization and relationships of various elements within the language chain. The schema provides a blueprint for how information is stored and processed.
2. **Model:** language models and chat models provide the ability to generate text and engage in conversations, while text embedding models enhance the understanding and representation of textual data.
3. **Prompts:** Prompts are input statements or questions provided to the language chain to elicit specific responses or actions. They act as instructions or cues for the system to generate relevant output.
4. **Indexes:** Indexes are data structures that facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of information within the language chain. They help in quickly locating relevant data and enhancing the overall performance of the system.
5. **Memory:** Memory refers to the storage component of the language chain that retains information and experiences over time. It enables the system to recall previously learned information and build upon it during interactions.
6. **Chains:** Chains are sequences of information or events linked together within the language chain. These chains can represent conversations, narratives, or any other contextual flow of information.
7. **Agent:** Based on the user's input, the agent can decide which tools to utilize, if any, to fulfill the user's request or provide the necessary information.
